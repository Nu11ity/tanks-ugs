## Unity Gaming Services Integration

This project is built as a template to easily create a solid base for one's multiplayer game when choosing to use Unity Gaming Services. The services used are Relay, Lobby, Multiplay, and Netcode for Gameobjects. I've added support for client-hosted games, which is ideal if you're trying to save on cost and go for a more casual game. If you're looking into doing something with competitive play, the dedicated server support is there. You can choose between connecting Multiplay through Unity's cloud dashboard or running your own dedicated servers.

## Prerequisites

This repository contains a Unity project that utilizes Unity Gaming Services. The integration relies on users connecting their own project service ID. In addition, set up their Relay, Lobby, and Multiplay services through the Unity Cloud dashboard.
